# Hyderabad Pakistan AQI Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting air quality levels in Hyderabad, Sindh (Pakistan) using real-time environmental data from the OpenWeather API. The goal is to build a practical machine learning pipeline that continuously updates and predicts future AQI trends.

## Project Overview

The notebook collects historical air pollution data for the past three months and applies feature engineering to extract meaningful patterns such as time-based features and pollution change metrics. A machine learning model is then trained to predict future AQI values.

The system is designed to work with live API data instead of static files, ensuring that predictions stay current and relevant.

## Key Features

* Real-time AQI data collection via OpenWeather API
* Automated feature engineering pipeline
* Exploratory data analysis and visualization
* Machine learning model training and evaluation
* Future AQI prediction for Hyderabad, Pakistan
* Version-controlled workflow using GitHub

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas & NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib & Seaborn
* OpenWeather API

## Purpose

This project was developed as part of an internship to demonstrate practical skills in data collection, feature engineering, and machine learning model deployment in a real-world scenario.
